# Basic Portfolio

## Description
This was an exercise in HTML and CSS learned this week in coding bootcamp. 

The exercise had us manipulate:
* Headers
* Footers
* Image placement
* Padding, margins, borders
* Linking pages
* Box model
* Float
* Wrapping
* Simple forms
* Navigation bar

All with CSS and HTML, no other languages, installations, or packages used.

## Lorem Ipsum No More
Instead of using the tired Lorem Ipsum, I went for Fyre Ipsum, check it out! <a href="https://fyreipsum.com/">Fyre Ipsum</a>.

## Roadmap
I intend to redesign this page with more advanced visuals and a working portfolio in the future using:

* JavaScript
* Bootstrap
* React.js

## Feedback
Open to feedback, I posted pain-points in the comments of the <a href="https://github.com/bretgithub/basic-portfolio/blob/master/assets/css/style.css">style.css</a> file. 

## Extra
extra.html was testing out other css tricks not covered but thought would be cool to include.
